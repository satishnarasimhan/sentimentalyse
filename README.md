# sentimentalyse

This project / activity is centered on sentimental analysis of tweets from a handle or discussion around a hashtag on Twitter.
It makes use of Twitter's tweepy and TextBlob Python packages. 
Tweepy helps gather and enumerate the data from the tweets or hashtags.
TextBlob provides a simple API for diving into common natural language processing (NLP) tasks. TextBlob provides the ability to handle part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, translation, word inflection, spell correction, etc. 
In this project, we wil look to use only the sentiment analysis feature to determine the polarity of an opinion.
